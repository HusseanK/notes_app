Notes App/widget

Creating a tkinter notes app widget for Project/Resume purposes



(IN PROGRESS)


PSA:
If anyone is wondering why i'm going to so much effort to actually re-create the widget all over again... 
I wanted to add 2 buttons onto my toolbar (settings/newnotepad)
However tkinter doesn't allow this, so i overrided it and i'm recreating it from scratch-ish :)
